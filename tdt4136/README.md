======
Semester: ()<-- insert here:[v15/v11/h09/]

# Academic content
The subject starts with a description of problem solving methods by means of heuristic search. Therafter, various knowledge representation languages and inference methods for automatic  problem solving. Representation in form of predicate logic, frames and semantic nets are treated, and connected to the main forms of reasoning - especially rule based reasoning. Furthermore, architectures that integrates various resoning methods, agent based architectures and architectures for interactive problem solving. Numerous applicaton examples are given to demonstrate the methods.

# Learning outcome
The subject shall give a general introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI), and its basis is taken from mathematics, logic and cognitive sciences. The subject aims at realising aspects of intelligent behaviour in computer systems.
