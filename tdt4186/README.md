======
Semester: ()<-- insert here:[v15/v11/h09/]

# Academic content
The topic will establish definitions, principles, frameworks and architectures for modern operating systems. The topic will focus on processes, thread systems, synchronization, CPU scheduling, memory management, file systems, input-output units, deadlock management, multi-processor systems and security. Important examples will be WINDOWS and LINUX.

# Learning outcome
Knowledge:
The course will give students an understanding of the tasks that an operating system solves, how tasks are solved and give an understanding of the use characteristics of an operating system. The themes are the kernel of the operating system, processes, threads, synchronization, time-sharing, memory management, file systems, I/O, deadlock management, multi-processor systems and security.

Skills:
The course will enable the students to exploit the operating system effectively, as system developers, as administrators and as end users. The course should enable them to do programming with threads and synchronization.

General qualifications:
Resource management. Software-hardware interfaces.
