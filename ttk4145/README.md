======
Semester: ()<-- insert here:[v15/v11/h09/]

# Academic content
Programming formalisms for real-time systems; POSIX, Ada, Java and Go. Threads/processes, synchronization and communication. Shared variable-based synchronization and resource control. Fault Tolerance, availability and consistency. Message-based synchronization, CSP and formal methods. Exercises and project.


# Learning outcome
Knowledge:
- Thorough knowledge of synchronization mechanisms like semaphores and monitors.
- Thorough knowledge of messagebased synchronization.
- Thorough knowledge of threads, processes, scheduling and synchronization in context of a real-time operating system.
- Thorough knowledge of common mistakes in real-time programming.
- Thorough knowledge of error handling and fault tolerance.
- Thorough knowledge of availability and consistency in systems with more threads/processes.
- Knowledge of the programming languages C, C++, Java, Ada and Go.
- Knowledge of CSP, formal methods and use of analysis tools for real-time systems.

Skills:
- Good skills in design and developement of real-time software, both based on shared variable synchronization and messagepassing.
- Ability to plan and execute a software developement project of significant complexity (~some thousand lines of C code)
- Good skills in using one programming language (probably C, C++, Java or ADA).
- The student should be able to relate constructively in his design to error handling and consistency in systems with more participants.

General Competence:
- Teamwork.
- IT and software developement in general.
