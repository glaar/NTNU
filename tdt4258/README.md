TDT4258 - Energy Efficient Computer Systems
======
Semester: ()<-- insert here:[v15/v11/h09/]

# Academic content
(a) Introduction: microcontrollers, software, programmable logic, peripherals.
(b) Hardware: microcontrollers and systems where microcontrollers are key components or possible solutions in parts of the system. Some relevant components and systems: AVR microcontrollers, FPGA-integrated Power-PC processors, development boards with microcontrollers and FPGAs, chips with microcontrollers. 
(c) Hardware programming: Programming for systems with limited resources. Compilers, C and assembler. HW/SW-interaction. Hardcoded/operative systems for microcontroller systems. 
(d) Interfaces and peripherals: Methods for accessing external units and potential special hardware resources as well as systems with peripheral processing units.


# Learning outcome
Knowledge:
- The student should know how software development for embedded systems is different from software development for traditional computers
- The student should know of different microcontrollers and their most common peripheral units
- The student should know of common techniques for programming close to hardware and the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques
- The student should know how common energy saving techniques works and the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques

Skills:
- The student should master programming close to hardware at different abstraction levels (assembly vs. high level languages with and without an operating system)
- The student should be able to use selected energy saving techniques

General competence:
- The student should master programming close to hardware and be able to use this knowledge in projects at all abstraction levels
