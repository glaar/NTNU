# Required previous knowledge


# Teaching methods and activities
Lectures, case discussions and compulsory exercise. A written, group-based exercise is compulsory; it is to be handed in towards the end of course and counts for 40% of the grade. A written exam by the end of the course constitutes the remaining 60% of the grade. When a concrete firm is used for the written obligatory assignment, the students can be required to sign a confidentiality agreement which regulates the relation between the firm and the students at the course. In cases of re-examination, an oral exam may substitute the written exam.
