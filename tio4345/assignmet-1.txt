Assignment # 1: Developing business relationships
Assignment 1 is empirical as well as conceptual. Procurement manager Karoline
Berbu Seth in Rolls-Royce Marine AS in Brattvåg, Norway will give a presentation
of how the firm has developed and manages one of their strategic supplier
relationships. The presentation will take place the 8 September, and you need to
be present to be able to do the assignment!! Based on her presentation of a real
buyer-supplier relationship within the maritime industry, the assignment should
cover the following issues:

1) Describe the firm’s buyer-supplier relationship
2) How has the relationship developed (from the start and until now)?
3) What characterises the collaborative relationship, for example which type of
different functions within the two firms have been/are involved in the
development of the relationship?
4) To what extent can theory on relationships explain the development of this
important relationship?

In the first three points it is expected that the issue will be covered using
literature from the curriculum and lectures actively as a structure and
framework for your empirical data. The fourth issue may be covered as a
reflection of the first three issues in a discussion where your findings
regarding the three first issues are contrasted with relevant theory on
relationships.
