In short: 
Describes levels of relationship and network management. Suggests 6 propositions about management of networks. Describes relationship specific tasks.

Long: (aka all the important stuffs)
# “business networks are not generally under control of an individual firm, but are self-organising system, in which order emerges in a bottom-up fashion from the local interactions taking place among firms in the relationship which they are involved.”

# A firm’s ability to develop and manage successfully its relationships with other firms may be viewed as a core competence , which varies among forms. 

#control as aspect in management. 

“hub firms” → strategic networks.

“have continually argued that firms are not in total control over their resources as other actors influence of restric actions take bua given firm.”

a firm may be able to choose its partners and control and direct the way the relationship operates. → Monopolist. 

# managing or being managed

to have a mutual relationship the perceived power between two companies have to be high. 

should firms try to manage their relationships and networks?

Ritter et.al suggests that firms van manages its network to a small extent. 

“We distinguish between ‘managing of’ and ’managing in’ relationships and networks, and between the proactive and reactive roles firms can play.”

# propositions:

a): The management of interactions with other firms and organisations both directly and indirectly is a key part of a firmæs managerial activities. b): The ability to effectively manage such interactions is critical for achieving economic goals and as such is a core competency of a firm and its personnel. c): The management of interactions on relationships is matched to relationships condition, including the different types of relative dependencies that exist between relationship partners. 

Management if business relationships and networks arise at the individual, group, or business unit and firm level and these levels are interrelated. 

Management in business relationships and networks involves relationship-specific and cross-relational tasks.

Relationship-specific tasks are change and coordination aimed at initiating, using, developing, routinizing and dissolving the relationship. 

Cross-relational tasks are planning, organising, staffing, and controlling aimed at dividing the overall value creation system into work packages and coordinating and integrating those. 

A firm's networking ability can only be understood in an ongoing, firm-wide process. 

# “All firms are simultaneously involved in the ongoing management of the network, and the resulting structure and performance is coproduced by their actions.”

# “On short, relationship and network management is about managing interactions with others, not about managing others.”

# “it is important to note that dyadic and cross-relational management tasks are ongoing and part of a continuous process of interaction taking place within and between relations.”

# “however, the current understanding of network management is limited, which poses implications for managers and researchers alike.”

# “The challenge for managers is to develop a networking ability that enables them to connect their resources to those of other actors. “

“one of the fundamental shifts in the 21str century is from a dyadic perspective of interorganizational exchange relationships towards a network perspective of value creation involving different types of network organizations.”

networks of organisations = Management, weakly manageable. 

network organization = manageability in the network, argued to have to be managed to be effective. 

intentional business networks = nets.
