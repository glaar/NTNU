We could do what we wanted to do. 

Hard to narrow it down. Research type of paper. 
needs theory and discussion, method and such. 

we have a lot of text, and material. the focus now should be to narrow it down to our contribution. 
what does our report answer?

introduction: we need a question to answer. What do we want to find out? 
research question?!

We have rich material. 

What is the direction?

we go for culture, but we need to define it early / in the introduction. 

need to motivate why we have chosen what we have chosen. 

do we have motivation in the literature today, for culture?

what is the over all goal?!

define focus?

why boundaries. why management. relation to strategy? state it clearly. 
missing the 'why' argumentation of the chosen particulars. 

shed light of different angles to choose in strategising.

culture was only mentioned in one article. It's a soft skill.

motivate that  

base of what is strategising. 
we go further and link it to cultural and global stuff. 

- Basic understanding
- where we take it with the soft skills. 

intro: mission statement. 
intro for each part: why this part is interesting in our context. followed by the theory we have.  
conclusion: summary of what we found and discussed so far, and summarise what is important for this aspect. 

redo the work based on the definiton of what we have. 


#intro: 
framework? 
1-2-3 is our framework for our discussion. 
if we keep the 'framework' create a figure with strategy in the middle, and link the different aspects of strategising. 

(end of intro)rq: what are the things affecting strategising in networks. 

#core concepts:
what is this?
--> considerations of strategising. that we have chosen. 

# classification of networks
why? is it essential? why does we have this aspect?
- the idea of the different networks is new. 
it brings on a normative view. it is how we should do it. 
'if in a network we should do this' --> in a network we have these structures to consider. 

why we present this. rewrite text, so it fits the other parts.
in our own words. why is classifying important as an aspect of strategising. 

#manage in networks. 
what does what mean?
- no comments :D

--> how to manage in a network. 

# why to succeed
what do we mean? 
why is it there? 

more direct influence on performance. 
success is an implication of being in a network. 

how is success a consideration in strategising?

# conclusion
first 4 considerations
then why. 

what does these 4 aspect mean in an international cultural aspect. 

how does the 4 aspects connect? 

# other. 
innovative angle. 
be systematic in headings. how should the reader consider this topic? 

organizational bourdaries. 
talking about relationships. 

network classifications: why is it interesting?!
- due to the different aspects of structure.
