Assignment # 2: Managing relationships and networks
Assignment 2 focuses on concepts for managing relationships and/or networks.
Inspired by the course literature and via discussion with the lecturers, the
group should choose a single relationship and/or network concept and describe,
compare and discuss different ways in which this concept has been addressed in
the literature. Examples of concepts are: key account management, supplier
development, supply network management, relationship portfolio management,
strategizing in networks, relationship initiation, trust, conflict handling in
relationships, business triads etc. The areas that the groups can choose their
concept from will be announced at Its Learning. When you have chosen a concept,
submit it to the coordinator by e-mail in order to get it approved before you
start writing. 

Using the literature from the curriculum and lectures that are relevant for the
concept as a starting point, it is expected that the group will identify at 3-5
additional articles/papers/books on the subject. The assignment should provide
an overview of what has been written on the subject so far, how the literature
has developed and what the central concepts are. Furthermore, the assignment
should compare the different contributions to the subject on for example
differences in scope, focus, approach and emphasis. In the discussion part the
previous parts of the assignment are seen as a whole in order to reach
conclusions and provide suggestions for future studies within the subject.
