I am pleased to see the level of reason brought to this discussion by Jim
Fischer and others. I agree with their thoughts that elimination of AFB is
not desirable even if possible, and that burning at the slightest sign of
infection is an ignorant response. The fact that it is legally required does
not mean it is an appropriate approach.
