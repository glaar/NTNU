Two basic rules in finance
-----
* Money today is more worth than money tomorrow. 
* Safe money is worth more then risky money. 
* Reward follows risk. 

Time value of money
-----
* 'Human impatience', present is better than future. 
* Don't consume now, invest, and consume more later. 
* Compounding: bring money to the future for comparison.
* Discounting: bring future money back, and than compare.

* Devaluation more often results in greater devaluation: 1.05^2 != 1.025^4

* Formulas for calculating interest. 
* Discretely compounded and completely compounded. 

* Annuities(annuitet) and perpetuities()

* Gordon growth model
** present value / (interest rate - inflation rate) = estimated value.

Utility and risk aversion
-----
* Utility is individual and situation dependant. 
* indifference curves. 
* Having a lot of something renders you willing to pay a lot of that something
 for a little of another thing.

Discounting in investment analysis
-----
* previous spending is no factor in new decisions.  
* Net present value.  
* payback period is a stupid way of making stupid decisions. 
* decide by cash flow. 
* 'internal rate of return' to calculate risk. 
* economic depreciation.
* 

The role of financial markets
----- 
* Fisher's optimal investment analysis.
